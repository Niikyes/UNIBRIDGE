# UNIBRIDGE
UNIBRIDGE is a national platform that allows students from public universities in Ecuador to find and apply for pre-professional internships at institutions that already have approved agreements with their universities. It seeks to address the problems of misinformation, lack of transparency, and disorganized management of these opportunities.
